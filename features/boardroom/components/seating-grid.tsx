/**
 * The board as a single row of seats.
 *
 * This used to be a 4-column grid of full cards, which put a seven-person
 * board into two rows with a hole in the bottom-right and pushed the
 * transcript — the thing anyone actually comes here to read — below the fold.
 * A flex row wraps at whatever count the roster happens to be and leaves no
 * empty cell, and the seats are small enough to stay pinned above the
 * conversation for the whole session.
 *
 * Vote outcome is a colored dot with an accessible label rather than a badge:
 * at this size a badge doubled the height of every seat for information that
 * is repeated in full in the consensus panel.
